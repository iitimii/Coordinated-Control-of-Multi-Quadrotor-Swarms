# My Final Year Project
This project explores the simulation and development of multiple quadrotors for formation control. Formation control is applied to enable quadrotors to fly in a centralized and cooperative manner, addressing challenges such as scalability, coordination, collision avoidance, and real-time decision-making. Applications include mapping, surveillance, and autonomous exploration.

Sorry the code and documentation is a bit messy, I'm working on it.
